aww.py
======

A CLI for adorable pictures.

## Usage

Installing is simple.

    alias aww="python aww.py"
    
To call the Reddit API with your username, use:

    "python aww.py your_username"

## Requirements

Ability to coo.

## Points of Notice

The cute images are sourced from Reddit's [r/aww](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww) subreddit, which is completely wonderful and perfect in every single way.  However (and for good reason!) the Reddit API limits requests to around fifty requests an hour; if your cuteness tolerance runs up against this wall, consider calling invoking app.py by appending your username to the script so the request lists your username as a user agent!
